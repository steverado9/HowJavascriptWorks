What is a programme?
A programme does two things 
-allocate memory: storing variables in the computeer
-parse and execute i.e read and run commands
Memory leak: This happens when we have unused memory, it fills up the memory heap 
The browser has a Javascript engine(v8 engine) which has a 
1)Memory heap: A place where it stores variable.
2)Call stack: read and run commands

Javascript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking.
it is single threaded beacuse it has one call stack.
Meaning it does one thing at a time.
This also means Javascript is synchronous i.e does one thing at a time(in order).
stackoverflow: when the call stack is full and overflow.

Javascript is non blocking: if Javascript code is holding up the line, it can move to the next one
This is where asynchronous Javascript comes in.

What is a Javascript run time environment
This is part of the browser
It has extra things apart from the v8 engine,
we also have 
-web apis
-call back queue
-Event loop
